Battle of the sexes


* wonder what happens when we compare elements of a factor,
 in factor_survey_vector we have a factor with two levels:
 "Male" and "Female"

but how does R value these relative to each other?

-----------------------------
eg (i) --->

test if male is greater than (>) female


# Build factor_survey_vector with clean levels
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")

# Male
male <- factor_survey_vector[1]

# Female
female <- factor_survey_vector[2]

# Battle of the sexes: Male 'larger' than female?
male > female


output :

NA
