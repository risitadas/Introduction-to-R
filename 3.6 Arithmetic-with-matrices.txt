Arithmetic with matrices


* the standard operators like +, -, /, *, etc. work in an element-wise way on matrices in R,

for example, 
2 * my_matrix multiplies each element of my_matrix by two


Instructions : 

i. divide all_wars_matrix by 5, giving us the number of visitors in millions,
assign the resulting matrix to visitors
ii. print out visitors


----------------------------

# all_wars_matrix is available in your workspace
all_wars_matrix

# Estimate the visitors
visitors <- all_wars_matrix/5
  
# Print the estimate to the console
visitors


output: 

# all_wars_matrix is available in your workspace
