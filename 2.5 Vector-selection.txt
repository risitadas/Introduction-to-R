Vector selection

* our goal is to select specific elements of the vector
* to select elements of a vector (and later matrices, data frames, …), use square brackets
* between the square brackets, indicate what elements to select

for example,
to select the first element of the vector, 
we type poker_vector[1]

to select the second element of the vector, 
we type poker_vector[2], etc. 

* the first element in a vector has index 1, not 0 as in many other programming languages


eg (i) ---> assigning the poker results of Wednesday to the variable poker_wednesday :

# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_wednesday <- poker_vector[3]



eg (ii) ---> assigning the poker results of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday to the variable poker_midweek :

# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_midweek <- poker_vector[c(2, 3, 4)]


* another way to find the mid-week results is poker_vector[2:4]

eg (iii) ---> assigning to roulette_selection_vector the roulette results from Tuesday up to Friday :

# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Define a new variable based on a selection
roulette_selection_vector <- roulette_vector[c(2:5)]


* another way to tackle the previous exercise is by using the names of the vector elements 
(Monday, Tuesday, …) instead of their numeric positions

for example,
poker_vector["Monday"]

will select the first element of poker_vector since "Monday" is the name of that first element

* we can also use the element names to select multiple elements, 

for example:

poker_vector[c("Monday","Tuesday")]


eg (iv) ---> 
# select the first three elements in poker_vector by using their names: "Monday", "Tuesday" and "Wednesday"
and then assign the result of the selection to poker_start
# also calculate the average of the values in poker_start with the mean() function,
print out the result so we can inspect it


# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Select poker results for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
poker_start <- poker_vector[c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday")]
  
# Calculate the average of the elements in poker_start
mean(poker_start)
