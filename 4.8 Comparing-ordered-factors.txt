Comparing ordered factors


eg --->

1. use [2] to select from factor_speed_vector the factor value for the second data analyst,
 store it as da2

2. use [5] to select the factor_speed_vector factor value for the fifth data analyst,
 store it as da5

3. check if da2 is greater than da5,
 simply print out the result

we can use the > operator to check whether one element is larger than the other



# Create factor_speed_vector
speed_vector <- c("medium", "slow", "s
low", "medium", "fast")
factor_speed_vector <- factor(speed_vector, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("slow", "medium", "fast"))

# Factor value for second data analyst
da2 <- factor_speed_vector[2]

# Factor value for fifth data analyst
da5 <- factor_speed_vector[5]

# Is data analyst 2 faster than data analyst 5?

da2 > da5


output:

[1] FALSE
