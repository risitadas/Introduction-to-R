Create a vector


eg (i) :

# Define the variable vegas
vegas <- "Go!"



* vectors are one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data

* in other words, a vector is a simple tool to store data

For example,we can store your daily gains and losses in the casinos

* in R, you create a vector with the combine function c() ,
we place the vector elements separated by a comma between the parentheses

For example:

numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")
Once we have created these vectors in R, we use them to do calculations!

eg (ii) :

numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Complete the code for boolean_vector
boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)


eg (iii) :

for this we collected all the winnings and losses for the last week of two games, as follows,

For poker_vector:

On Monday you won $140
Tuesday you lost $50
Wednesday you won $20
Thursday you lost $120
Friday you won $240

For roulette_vector:

On Monday you lost $24
Tuesday you lost $50
Wednesday you won $100
Thursday you lost $350
Friday you won $10

we only played poker and rouletter, since there was a delegation of mediums that occupied the craps tables,
hence, to be able to use this data in R, we decide to create the variables poker_vector and roulette_vector

now assigning winnings/losses for both, separately,

# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <-  c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
