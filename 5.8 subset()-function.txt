Only planets with rings but shorter


function subset() :
* function is a short-cut to do exactly the same as what we did previously

subset(my_df, subset = some_condition)


* first argument of subset() specifies the dataset for which we want a subset
* by adding the second argument, we give R the necessary information and conditions to select the correct subset

we can rewrite without the need of rings_vector as -

subset(planets_df, subset = rings)


eg --->

useing subset() on planets_df to select planets that have a diameter smaller than Earth,
because the diameter variable is a relative measure of the planet's diameter w.r.t that of planet Earth, 
our condition is diameter < 1


# planets_df is pre-loaded in your workspace
planets_df
# Select planets with diameter < 1
subset(planets_df, subset = diameter < 1)


output :

planets_df
