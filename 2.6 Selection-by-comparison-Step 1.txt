Selection by comparison - Step 1


* by making use of comparison operators, we can approach the previous question in a more proactive way

* the (logical) comparison operators known to R are:

< for less than
> for greater than
<= for less than or equal to
>= for greater than or equal to
== for equal to each other
!= not equal to each other

like,
stating 6 > 5 returns TRUE

* we can use these comparison operators also on vectors

for example:

c(4, 5, 6) > 5
[1] FALSE FALSE TRUE

* this command tests for every element of the vector if the condition stated 
by the comparison operator is TRUE or FALSE.


eg --->

# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Which days did you make money on poker?
selection_vector <- poker_vector > 0
  
# Print out selection_vector
selection_vector

output:

selection_vector
   Monday   Tuesday Wednesday  Thursday    Friday 
     TRUE     FALSE      TRUE     FALSE      TRUE
