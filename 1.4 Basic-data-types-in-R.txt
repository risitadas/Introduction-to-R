Basic data types in R


R works with numerous data types. 

some of the most basic types to get started are:

*decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
*whole numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
*boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
*text (or string) values are called characters.


eg (i):

# Change my_numeric to be 42
my_numeric <- 42

# Change my_character to be "universe"
my_character <- "universe"

# Change my_logical to be FALSE
my_logical <- FALSE


eg (ii) :

# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE 

# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)
