Ordered factors - 2


* speed_vector should be converted to an ordinal factor since its categories have a natural ordering
* by default, the function factor() transforms speed_vector into an unordered factor
* to create an ordered factor, add two additional arguments: 

ordered and levels.

factor(some_vector,
       ordered = TRUE,
       levels = c("lev1", "lev2" ...))

* by setting the argument ordered to TRUE in the function factor(), 
we indicate that the factor is ordered
* with the argument levels we give the values of the factor in the correct order

-----------------------------------

eg --->

from speed_vector, 
create an ordered factor vector: factor_speed_vector,
set ordered to TRUE, and set levels to c("slow", "medium", "fast")


# Create speed_vector
speed_vector <- c("medium", "slow", "slow", "medium", "fast")

# Convert speed_vector to ordered factor vector
factor_speed_vector <- factor(speed_vector, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("slow", "medium", "fast"))

# Print factor_speed_vector
factor_speed_vector
summary(factor_speed_vector)


output:

factor_speed_vector

[1] medium slow   slow   medium fast  
Levels: slow < medium < fast

summary(factor_speed_vector)

  slow medium   fast 
     2      2      1
