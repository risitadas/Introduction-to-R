Selecting elements from a list


* list will often be built out of numerous elements and components
* therefore, getting a single element, multiple elements, or a component out of it is not always 
	straightforward.

* one way to select a component is using the numbered position of that component

for example, to "grab" the first component of shining_list , we type

shining_list[[1]]

* we refer to the names of the components, with [[ ]] or with the $ sign
* both will select the data frame representing the reviews:

shining_list[["reviews"]]
shining_list$reviews

* besides selecting components, we often need to select specific elements out of these components,

 For example, with 
shining_list[[2]][1] ,
we select from the second component, 

actors (shining_list[[2]]), 
the first element ([1]) ,

we see the answer is Jack Nicholson


eg --->

i. select from shining_list the vector representing the actors and print out this vector
ii. select from shining_list the second element in the vector representing the actors and print the same



# shining_list is already pre-loaded in the workspace
shining_list

# Print out the vector representing the actors
shining_list$actors

# Print the second element of the vector representing the actors
shining_list$actors[2]


output :
