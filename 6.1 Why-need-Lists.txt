Why we need Lists?


we know:

* Vectors (one dimensional array): 
	can hold numeric, character or logical values. 
	The elements in a vector all have the same data type.
* Matrices (two dimensional array): 
	can hold numeric, character or logical values. 
	The elements in a matrix all have the same data type.
* Data frames (two-dimensional objects): 
	can hold numeric, character or logical values. 
	Within a column all elements have the same data type,
	but different columns can be of different data type.

and,

* Lists:
	are the R objects which contain elements of different types like 
	âˆ’ numbers, strings, vectors and another list inside it. 
	also contain a matrix or a function as its elements.
	is a collection of data which is ordered and changeable
