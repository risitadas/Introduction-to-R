Categorical variables


two types:
i. nominal categorical variable 
ii. ordinal categorical variable


* nominal variable is a categorical variable without an implied order,
this means that it is impossible to say that 'one is worth more than the other'

for example, 
think of the categorical variable animals_vector with the categories 
"Elephant", "Giraffe", "Donkey" and "Horse"

Here, it is impossible to say that one stands above or below the other

* ordinal variables do have a natural ordering,

for example,
the categorical variable temperature_vector with the categories:
 "Low", "Medium" and "High" ,
here it is obvious that "Medium" stands above "Low", and "High" stands above "Medium"

eg --->

# Animals
animals_vector <- c("Elephant", "Giraffe", "Donkey", "Horse")
factor_animals_vector <- factor(animals_vector)
factor_animals_vector

# Temperature
temperature_vector <- c("High", "Low", "High","Low", "Medium")
factor_temperature_vector <- factor(temperature_vector, order = TRUE, levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))
factor_temperature_vector


output :

factor_animals_vector
[1] Elephant Giraffe  Donkey   Horse   
Levels: Donkey Elephant Giraffe Horse

factor_temperature_vector
[1] High   Low    High   Low    Medium
Levels: Low < Medium < High
