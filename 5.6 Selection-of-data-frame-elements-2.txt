Selection of data frame elements-2


* instead of using numerics to select elements of a data frame, 
we can also use the variable names to select columns of a data frame

* suppose we want to select the first three elements of the type column, one way to do this is

	planets_df[1:3,2]

* one possible disadvantage of this approach is that we have to know (or look up)
 the column number of type, which gets hard if we have a lot of variables
* it is often easier to just make use of the variable name:

planets_df[1:3,"type"]


eg--->

select and print out the first 5 values in the "diameter" column of planets_df

# The planets_df data frame from the previous exercise is pre-loaded
planets_df[1:5,"diameter"]
# Select first 5 values of diameter column


output:

[1]  0.382  0.949  1.000  0.532 11.209
