Variable assignments


a basic concept in (statistical) programming is called a variable.

a variable allows us to store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g. a function description) in R 
we can then later use this variable's name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable

for example :

we can assign a value 4 to a variable my_var with the command

my_var <- 4 



eg (i) ---> 

# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42

# Print out the value of the variable x
x


eg (ii) --->

Suppose we have a fruit basket with five apples, as a data analyst in training, 
we want to store the number of apples in a variable with the name my_apples :

# Assign the value 5 to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Print out the value of the variable my_apples
my_apples


eg (iii) --->

we want to calculate how many pieces of fruit we have in total,
after adding another basket of six oranges:

# Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples  <- 5
my_oranges <- 6

# Add these two variables together
my_apples + my_oranges

# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges
my_fruit


eg (iv) :

# Assign a value to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5 

# Fix the assignment of my_oranges
my_oranges <- 6 

# Create the variable my_fruit and print it out
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges 
my_fruit
