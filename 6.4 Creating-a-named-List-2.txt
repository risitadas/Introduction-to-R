Creating a named list-2


eg --->


create shining_list, it contains three elements:

* moviename: a character string with the movie title (stored in mov)
* actors: a vector with the main actors' names (stored in act)
* reviews: a data frame that contains some reviews (stored in rev)

 name the list components accordingly (names are moviename, actors and reviews)



# The variables mov, act and rev are available

# Finish the code to build shining_list
shining_list <- list(moviename = mov, actors = act, reviews = rev)
