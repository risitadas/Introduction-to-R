How it works?


R makes use of the # sign to add comments, so that we and others can understand 
what the R code is about,comments are not run as R code,so they will not influence our result

For example, Calculate 3 + 4 , is a comment :

# Calculate 3 + 4
3 + 4

# Calculate 6 + 12
6 + 12
