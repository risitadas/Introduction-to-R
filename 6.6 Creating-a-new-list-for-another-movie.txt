Creating a new list for another movie


* we found reviews of another, more recent, Jack Nicholson movie: The Departed!

Scores	Comments

4.6	I would watch it again
5	Amazing!
4.8	I liked it
5	One of the best movies
4.2	Fascinating plot


* its useful to collect together all the pieces of information about the movie, 
like the title, actors, and reviews into a single variable
* since these pieces of data are different shapes, it is natural to combine them in a list variable

	movie_title, 

containing the title of the movie, and
 	movie_actors, 
containing the names of some of the actors in the movie, are available in our workspace


eg ---> 


i. create two vectors, called scores and comments, that contain the information from the reviews 
	shown in the table
ii. find the average of the scores vector and save it as avg_review
iii. combine the scores and comments vectors into a data frame called reviews_df
iv. create a list, called departed_list, that contains the movie_title, movie_actors, 
	reviews data frame as reviews_df, and the average review score as avg_review, and print it out



# Use the table from the exercise to define the comments and scores vectors
scores <- c(4.6, 5, 4.8, 5, 4.2)
comments <- c("I would watch it again", "Amazing!", "I liked it", "One of the best movies", "Fascinating plot")

# Save the average of the scores vector as avg_review
avg_review <- mean(scores)


# Combine scores and comments into the reviews_df data frame
reviews_df <- data.frame(scores, comments)

# Create and print out a list, called departed_list
departed_list <- list(movie_title, movie_actors, reviews_df, avg_review)
departed_list


output:

departed_list
