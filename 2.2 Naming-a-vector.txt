Naming a vector


As a data analyst, it is important to have a clear view on the data that we are using
and understanding what each element refers to is therefore essential


*previously, we created a vector with our winnings over the week
*each vector element refers to a day of the week but its hard to tell which element belongs to which day
*thus we name them, ie, give a name to the elements of the vector with the names() function

for example,

some_vector <- c("John Doe", "poker player")
names(some_vector) <- c("Name", "Profession")

*here it first creates a vector some_vector and then gives the two elements a name
*the first element is assigned the name Name, while the second element is labeled Profession
*printing the contents to the console yields following output:

          Name     Profession 
    "John Doe" "poker player"


eg (i) :

adding the same for the elements in poker_vector with the days of the week as well as for roulette_vector -->

# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

# Assign days as names of poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# Assign days as names of roulette_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")


*there's also a more efficient way to do the same by assigning the days of the week vector to a variable,

# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

# The variable days_vector
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
 
# Assign the names of the day to roulette_vector and poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <-  days_vector 
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector
