What's a matrix?


* in R, a matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type (numeric, character, or logical) 
arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns

* since we are only working with rows and columns, a matrix is called two-dimensional

* we can construct a matrix in R with the matrix() function

considering the following example:

matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)

* in the matrix() function:

(i) the first argument is the collection of elements that R will arrange into the rows and columns of the matrix

 we use 1:9 which is a shortcut for c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

(ii) the argument byrow indicates that the matrix is filled by the rows

If we want the matrix to be filled by the columns, we just place byrow = FALSE

(iii) the third argument nrow indicates that the matrix should have three rows


eg --->

# construct a matrix with 3 rows containing the numbers 1 up to 9, filled row-wise

matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)


output:

    [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    2    3
[2,]    4    5    6
[3,]    7    8    9
