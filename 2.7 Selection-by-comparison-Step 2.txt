Selection by comparison - Step 2


* previously we used 

selection_vector <- poker_vector > 0 

to find the days on which we had a positive poker return

* now, we would like to know not only the days on which we won, but also how much weu won on those days

* we can select the desired elements, by putting 
selection_vector 
between the square brackets that follow poker_vector:

poker_vector[selection_vector]

R knows what to do when we pass a logical vector in square brackets: 
it will only select the elements that correspond to TRUE in selection_vector.


eg ---> using selection_vector in square brackets to assign the amounts 
that we won on the profitable days to the variable poker_winning_days

# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Which days did you make money on poker?
selection_vector <- poker_vector > 0

# Select from poker_vector these days
poker_winning_days <- poker_vector[selection_vector]
