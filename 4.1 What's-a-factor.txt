What's a factor?


* the term factor refers to a statistical data type used to store categorical variables 
* difference between a categorical variable and a continuous variable is that a categorical variable 
can belong to a limited number of categories
* a continuous variable, on the other hand, can correspond to an infinite number of values
* it is important that R knows whether it is dealing with a continuous or a categorical variable, 
as the statistical models we will develop in the future treat both types differently

------------------------------------
eg (i) --->

Assign to variable theory the value "factors" ---->


# Assign to the variable theory what this chapter is about!

theory <- "factors"

-----------------------------------------


* to create factors in R, we can make use of the function factor()
* first thing that to do is create a vector that contains all the observations that belong to a 
limited number of categories 

for example, 
sex_vector contains the sex of 5 different individuals:

sex_vector <- c("Male","Female","Female","Male","Male")

* it is clear that there are two categories, or in R-terms 'factor levels', at work here:

 "Male" and "Female".

the function factor() will encode the vector as a factor:

factor_sex_vector <- factor(sex_vector)

--------------------------------------------
eg (ii) --->


i. convert the character vector sex_vector to a factor with factor() and assign the result 
to factor_sex_vector

ii. print out factor_sex_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels 
below the actual values


# Sex vector
sex_vector <- c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male")

# Convert sex_vector to a factor
factor_sex_vector <- factor(sex_vector)

# Print out factor_sex_vector
factor_sex_vector 


output:

factor_sex_vector 

[1] Male   Female Female Male   Male  
Levels: Female Male
