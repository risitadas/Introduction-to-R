Naming a matrix


* to help remembering what is stored in star_wars_matrix, 
we would like to add the names of the movies for the rows
* not only does this help you to read the data, 
but it is also useful to select certain elements from the matrix

* similar to vectors, we can add names for the rows and the columns of a matrix

rownames(my_matrix) <- row_names_vector
colnames(my_matrix) <- col_names_vector

We went ahead and prepared two vectors : region, and titles
we will need these vectors to name the columns and rows of star_wars_matrix, respectively


Instructions

1. using colnames() to name the columns of star_wars_matrix with the region vector
2. using rownames() to name the rows of star_wars_matrix with the titles vector
3. print out star_wars_matrix to see the result


-----------------------------


# Box office Star Wars (in millions!)
new_hope <- c(460.998, 314.4)
empire_strikes <- c(290.475, 247.900)
return_jedi <- c(309.306, 165.8)

# Construct matrix
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(c(new_hope, empire_strikes, return_jedi), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Vectors region and titles, used for naming
region <- c("US", "non-US")
titles <- c("A New Hope", "The Empire Strikes Back", "Return of the Jedi")

# Name the columns with region
colnames(star_wars_matrix) <- region



# Name the rows with titles
rownames(star_wars_matrix) <- titles

# Print out star_wars_matrix
star_wars_matrix



output:

star_wars_matrix
                             US non-US
A New Hope              460.998  314.4
The Empire Strikes Back 290.475  247.9
Return of the Jedi      309.306  165.8
