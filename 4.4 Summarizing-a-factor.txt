Summarizing a factor


 summary()
* this will give a quick overview of the contents of a variable:

summary(my_var)


eg (i) --->

i. ask a summary() of the survey_vector and factor_survey_vector,
and then interpret the results of both vectors

# Build factor_survey_vector with clean levels
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")
factor_survey_vector

# Generate summary for survey_vector
summary(survey_vector)

# Generate summary for factor_survey_vector
summary(factor_survey_vector)


output:

summary(survey_vector)

Length     Class      Mode 
   5    character   character 

summary(factor_survey_vector)
