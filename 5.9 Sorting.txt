Sorting


* in data analysis  we can sort our data according to a certain variable in the dataset
* in R, this is done with the help of the function order()

*order() is a function that gives the ranked position of each element when it is applied on 
 a variable, such as a vector ,
for example:

a <- c(100, 10, 1000)
order(a)
[1] 2 1 3

10, which is the second element in a, is the smallest element, 
so 2 comes first in the output of order(a),
100, which is the first element in a is the second smallest element, 
so 1 comes second in the output of order(a)

this means we can use the output of order(a) to reshuffle a:

a[order(a)]
[1]   10  100 1000


eg --->

# Play around with the order function in the console

a <- c(985, 95, 9858, 95876, 09)
order(a)
a[order(a)]


output :

order(a)
[1] 5 2 1 3 4

a[order(a)]
[1]     9    95   985  9858 95876
