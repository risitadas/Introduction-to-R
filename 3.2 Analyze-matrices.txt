Analyse matrices
   ---> analyse the box office numbers of the Star Wars franchise

*three vectors are defined 
*each one represents the box office numbers from the first three Star Wars movies
*the first element of each vector indicates the US box office revenue, 
*the second element refers to the Non-US box office

we have to combine all these figures into a single vector and then build a matrix from this vector

Instructions

1. use c(new_hope, empire_strikes, return_jedi) to combine the three vectors into one vector,
lets call this vector box_office

2. construct a matrix with 3 rows, where each row represents a movie
we use the matrix() function to do this so the first argument is the vector box_office, 
containing all box office figures,next, we'll have to specify nrow = 3 and byrow = TRUE,
naming the resulting matrix as star_wars_matrix

# Box office Star Wars (in millions!)
new_hope <- c(460.998, 314.4)
empire_strikes <- c(290.475, 247.900)
return_jedi <- c(309.306, 165.8)

# Create box_office
box_office <- c(new_hope, empire_strikes, return_jedi)

# Construct star_wars_matrix
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)
