Factor levels


* when we first get a dataset, it contains factors with specific factor levels,
however, sometimes we want to change the names of these levels for clarity or other reasons,
R allows us to do this with the function 
levels():

levels(factor_vector) <- c("name1", "name2",...)

a good illustration is the raw data that is provided by a survey,
a common question for every questionnaire is the sex of the respondent, 
here, for simplicity, just two categories were recorded, "M" and "F"

survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")

in the time of analyzing the data we to change the factor levels to "Male" and "Female" 
instead of "M" and "F" for clarity


---------------------------------------------
eg (i) --->

i. check out the code that builds a factor vector from survey_vector, use factor_survey_vector 
in the next instruction

ii. change the factor levels of factor_survey_vector to c("Female", "Male"),and 
mind the order of the vector elements here.


# Code to build factor_survey_vector
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)

# Specify the levels of factor_survey_vector
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")

factor_survey_vector

output:

factor_survey_vector

[1] Male   Female Female Male   Male  
Levels: Female Male
