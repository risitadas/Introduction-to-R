Ordered factors


* since "Male" and "Female" are unordered (or nominal) factor levels, 
R returns a warning message, telling that the greater than operator is not meaningful

* R attaches an equal value to the levels for such factors

* sometimes we will also deal with factors that do have a natural ordering between its categories

eg (i) --->

assign speed_vector a vector with 5 entries, one for each analyst,
 each entry should be either "slow", "medium", or "fast". Use the list below:

i. analyst 1 is medium,
ii. analyst 2 is slow,
iii. analyst 3 is slow,
iv. analyst 4 is medium and
v. analyst 5 is fast.

no need to specify these are factors yet


# Create speed_vector
speed_vector <- c("medium", "slow", "slow", "medium", "fast")
